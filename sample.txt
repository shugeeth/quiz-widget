The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating arabic material is that the letter 'sheen' and the word 'shayun' in arabic can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that 'sh' sound. So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the 'ck' sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years.
